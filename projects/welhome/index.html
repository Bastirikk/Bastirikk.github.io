    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p>Welhome is an app for Loughborough University students who struggle to find accomodation as the new academic year starts. The aim is to improve the wellbeing, organization, communication and academic success by identifying and applying an iterative human centred process.</p>

    <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
    <p>Welhome requires a design for an iOS mobile app, along with clearly defined branding that is connected to Loughborough University’s branding. The experience can be presented in a prototype that effectively shows the key features users need from an accommodation finding app with the help of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To understand the current industry and audience through research</p>
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> Secondary Research | Assumptions | User Interviews</p>
      <p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Research Findings | Quotes</p>
    </div>

    <h4>SECONDARY RESEARCH</h4>
    <p>To know what to learn from user interviews, we made a secondary research and created a concrete base for our research.</p>
    <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/stats.png'>

    <h4>ASSUMPTIONS</h4>
    <p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> New city - Unknown environment - Complicated contracts</p>
    <p><strong>Emotional:</strong> Isolation - Feeling lost - Different language/culture</p>

    <h4>USER INTERVIEWS</h4>
    <p>We conducted 1:1 user interviews as primary research in order to learn directly from <b>potential users about how they found their current and past accommodations, dig through their experiences and what they would like to have in their future accomodation search.</b> The interviews were conducted in-person and all participants identified themselves as newcomers to Loughborough.</p>

    <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/demographics.png'>

    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To define the target user’s needs, goals, motivations and frustrations based on research findings</p>
    <p><strong>Used Techniques:</strong> Contextual Interviews | Timeline Technique | Card Sorting Activity | Creative Brainstorming</p>

    <h5>Timeline Technique</h5>
    <p>We asked our participants to recall a accomodation searching memory in a new city preferably Loughborough and draw a timeline according to the key points they encountered. This helped the process to be smoother by reminding them the process detailly and expressing themselves easily.</p>

    <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/timeline.png'>

    <h5>Card Sorting Activity</h5>
    <p>Then we gave them some cards related to the possible priorities of them when choosing an accomodation and asked to sort them in their importance order. Then talked detailly about each card, also we gave them the flexibility to add their own cards.</p>

    <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/cardsort.png'>

    <h5>Creative Brainstorming</h5>
    <p>We asked them to imagine a <b>god-like figure</b> and ask them what would they want from him/her. It is beneficial and easy to gather insights from surreal ideas of participants since it gives hints about the deeply lying problems they encounter but they won’t mention in normal situations.</p>

      <p><strong>Process / Deliverables:</strong> Affinity Map | Persona | HMW Questions | Business & User Goals</p>
    </div>

    <h4>AFFINITY MAPPING</h4>
    <p>After transcribing the recordings of my conversations, I organized participants’ statements according to patterns that emerged. Then we grouped those statements based on <b>commonalities</b> and <b>themes</b> to determine <b>key insights</b> and identify <b>user needs</b>.</p>

    <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/sorting.png'>

    <h4>PERSONAS</h4>
    <p>After creating the affinity map we developed 2 primary personas, fictional representations of our target users, landlord and school representative. Creating a persona helped us to humanize our target user and see their pain points and experience goals they wanna reach with the possible application.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h4>BUSINESS & USER GOALS</h4>
    <p>We identified the business and user goals for the product. The business goals were drawn from the <b>project brief</b> and <b>landlord persona</b>, the user goals were pulled directly from <b>student personas</b>. The common points among these two sets of these goals were then used to generate <b>shared goals</b>, which I considered as well.</p>

      <p><strong>Process / Deliverables:</strong> Storyboard | App Map | Design Principles</p>
    </div>

    <h4>STORYBOARD</h4>
    <p>I wanted to further explore how WelHome might meet one of Min’s needs, like suggesting <b>on-point houses</b> when she is abroad and after signing up for a house it <b>eliminated the complicated</b> contract reading by <b>smart contract analyser</b>.</p>

    <img class='img-fluid mt-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/story1.png'>
    <img class='img-fluid mb-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/story2.png'>

    <h4>APP MAP</h4>
    <p>In the end product, it was wanted to present a <b>user flow</b> that shows the <b>key features</b> of WelHome. In order to do that, I decided on an <b>app map</b> to ease the process. This gave me which pages are <b>necessary</b> and how <b>logical connections</b> can be made between the screens.</p>

    <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/map.png'>

    <h4>DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h4>
    <p>Before jumping to wireframing I wanted to determine design principles of Welhome. since the audience is <b>students</b> which are in the category of <b>young adults</b> and the researches stated that they are <b>visually oriented</b>, they are <b>sensitive to application language</b> and they are <b>confident</b> in their own ability to navigate digital interfaces even when encountering <b>radically new design patterns</b>.</p>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To design an optimum layout and look for WelHome</p>
      <p><strong>Process / Deliverables:</strong> Sketches | Wireframe | Branding</p>
    </div>

    <h4>SKETCHES</h4>
    <p>After determining the basis of the application the trial sketches have been made. What is need to be added functionally wher it should be placed are decided roughly.</p>

    <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/sketch.png'>

    <h4>WIREFRAME</h4>
    <p>The sketches converted into wireframes using <b>Sketch</b> and the detailed layout is achieved for <b>user-testing</b>.</p>

    <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/wireframe.png' style="width: 900px;">

    <h4>BRANDING</h4>
    <p>I developed a branding for Welhome with keeping in mind the design principles that I determined earlier: <b>Friendly, innovative, universal, direct communication</b>.</p>

        <p>The wireframes created in Sketch is taken to Marvel app and clickable buttons are set for user flow. A Loughborough student (who was familiar with the topic since she had some bad experiences in finding suitable accomodation in various cities (Swansea and Loughborough) went through the pre-determined user flow and afterwards an interview is conducted about the design issues she encountered.</p>

      <p><strong>Process / Deliverables:</strong> Iteration</p>
    </div>

    <h4>ITERATION</h4>
    <p>In the light of the comments and my individual evalution I decided to change some parts of my design. I believe with this little touches the overall experience enhanced significantly.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
    <p>After implementing the UI properties to the iterated version of WelHome, the final design is ready. The overall experience is a linear one to show every feature of the application rather than giving testers the optimum freedom.</p>
