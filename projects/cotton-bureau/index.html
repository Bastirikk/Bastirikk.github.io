    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p>Cotton Bureau is an online community where designers put up their graphical talents and combine with quality soft tees, hoodies etc. It is a website where you can either upload a visual and start your process of being a commissioned designer or you can just buy any graphical t-shirt, in various sizes, colours and cloth types.</p>
    <p><a href="https://cottonbureau.com/shop">Cotton Bureau Website <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p>

    <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
    <p>Cotton Bureau website already exists but needs a new design due to some usability and accessibility issues. A responsive design along with clearly defined branding that isn’t changed much from its original. The new experience is presented in a prototype that effectively shows the main changes made accordingly to the in-depth user research.</p>

    <div class="summary text-center my-3">
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To understand the current inadequacies Cotton Bureau Website have</p>
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> Survey | Expert Review Assessment | <br> Satisfaction Assessment | Performance Assessment</p>
      <p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Research Findings</p>
    </div>

    <h4>SURVEY</h4>
    <p>‘The top 5 most important tasks when you buy clothes online’ question is asked to 74 people and according to their answers, we decided on what online apparel shoppers care the most in a website and which features they would like to see.</p>
    <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto picture' src='images/Survey-CB.png'>
    <p>Like in the image above, the most important tasks determined, and we will refer them as Top Tasks, which are Delivery, Image Quality and Customer Reviews. Also, the other 5 answers which still have big impact (Size and Fit information, Product Descriptions, Returns, Filtering, Product Search) will be taken into consideration when analyzing Cotton Bureau’s website.</p>

    <h4>EXPERT REVIEW ASSESSMENT</h4>
    <p>Being aware of the positive and negative features of the website that we are analyzing is crucial and that’s why expert review assessment is conducted on Cotton Bureau’s website. After the review and finding out the usability and accessibility problems whether they are important or relatively have less impact on the users’ journey, we compared them with the general guidelines – Nielsen Heuristics and WCAG 2.0.</p>

    <h5>• Results and Discussion</h5>
    <p>The evaluation of Home Page and its MoSCoW table is shown below. Like other 3 of Cotton Bureau’s Pages (Search Page (California), Product Page (California) and Checkout Page) are evaluated with MoSCoW tables too.</p>

    <h4>MoSCoW ANALYSIS</h4>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To brainstorm on how to make changes to enhance the user experience of Cotton Bureau website</p>
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> Sketches</p>
    </div>

    <h4>SKETCHES</h4>
    <p>Before moving on to the Hi-Fi design, some sketches were made to spark some ideas and see what can be changed. Many trials and categorization methods were tried to find the optimum top banner for Cotton Bureau and for the product page the changes were highlighted and added.</p>

    <span class='d-inline-block num'>4</span>
    <h2 class='d-inline-block section'>REDESIGN</h2>
    <div class="summary text-center my-3">
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create the first redesign according to the researches have been made</p>
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> 1st Redesign</p>
    </div>

    <h4>1st REDESIGN</h4>
    <p>In the overall design, the basic design elements (like colors, fonts, general layout etc.) kept the same since they weren’t causing any confusions and problems in the user journey. The changes were more like the structure of the website and adding little but crucial details.</p>
  </div>

  <img class='img-fluid my-5 d-block mx-auto' src='images/1stredesign-total-cb.png'>
  
  <div>

    <h4>FINAL DESIGN</h4>
    <p>In the final day we turned our wireframes into final design with adding the UI aspects. Deciding on colours and fonts didn’t take much time but adding interactions were the most challenging part. During integrating UI to wireframe we iterated some parts and decided on the final look.</p>
    <p>I believe we expressed our priority of creating collaborative memories in a clear guidance to our users, and the little details in the memory adding screens are on point and creates nice shortcuts to locations, feelings and tips.</p>
